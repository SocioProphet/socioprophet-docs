title: "Introduction - Platform"
description: "SocioProphet I/O is an open, platform built with open-source technology that is focused on facilitating collaborative data analytics for our technical community of users. We believe that everyone on earth benefits from shared knowledge, open data, open infrastructure, and transparent governence--even large for-profit institutions. SocioProphet I/O provides everyone in the world access to state of the art technical capabilities to solve two major industry gaps: 

1. Most of the earth doesn't have access to a data lake / analytics environment; and, 

2. A majority of companies and institutions that do build / make these platforms available do not have the skills, discipline, or experience to build or manage these platforms for their growing communities of users. "
