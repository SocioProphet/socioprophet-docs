title: "Introduction - SocioProphet Dev"
description: "SocioProphet Dev provides an open, configurable, community driven platform for our users that allows our users a seamless, integrated experience across devices from edge to cloud. There is not a single developer focused community focused on transparent, secure dev-sec-ops, that addresses the needs of both power users and noobs in a reproducible, enterprise-ready way. Simply put, socioprophet.dev is a community platform and integrated developer environment that takes the pain out of dev ops best practices for individual users, system critical projects, and enterprises without vendor lock-in or a PaaS solution that developers find less than appealing."
